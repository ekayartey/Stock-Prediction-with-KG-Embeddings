# Stock-Prediction-with-KG-Embeddings

The study would generate knowledge graph (KG) embeddings using the TransE model as well as the Knowledge Graph by Multi-Label (KGML) models, and evaluate which modelâ€™s KG embeddings best improve the performance of a stock prediction model. The study shall build a text corpus of financial news headlines scrapped from the internet; organize them into entities and relations tuples to form knowledge graphs; generate knowledge graph embeddings, and add historical prices and technical indicators to predict stock price movement; and to finally, evaluating how these KG embedding affects the prediction capability of a stock prediction model developed with Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) architecture.
